MonsterIndia.com
An Experience of project building at Masai School

This blog is to share our experience working as a team to build a pixel-perfect clone of MonsterIndia.com as a part of the construct week program of Masai School.

We did this entire project in a span of 3 days as a collaborative project of 5 members: Sonali Ghorpade, Ashish Kumar, Akriti Jain, Harsha Umesh, Niranjan Salunkhe.

Since we had very limited time to clone an entire website we skipped some of the repetitive pages of the website and focused on the main pages which covered most of the functionality like the Landing page, Product listing pages, Sign In, and Sign up page, and gave our best to clone theses pages.

Take a look at the snippets, these ![image (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101391587/193396256-9c540736-5665-4f6a-bfb6-62831cbbad15.png)

are just some of the pages of our cloned website.

Tech Stack we used for creating this website is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used most of the concepts we were taught to build the website like DOM manipulation, Grid system, etc.

Even though we were working remotely we did not face any challenges in communicating as every member of our team was effective in communicating and was very much approachable.

We started the project by splitting the tasks among us depending on our abilities and expertise. Ashish worked on the Home page, Akriti on the Job Search page, Sonali on the Premium Services page, Harsha on the Work From Home page, and Niranjan on the Career Tips page. While building the pages individually we had to make sure that all of our work is in sync and our codes don’t conflict with one another. it was quite challenging to achieve similar results to the original website. We had decided to complete the basic template of the website first and add the functionality before spending time on styling, with the expectation of finishing the project before time. If anyone of us would face any issue other members would always help him/her in solving the issue.


We achieved these results which were above our expectations, considering we were working together for the first time. all of this was possible because of the sheer hard work and dedication of each and every member. The understanding we had during this project was one of the reasons this project turned out to be amazing.
